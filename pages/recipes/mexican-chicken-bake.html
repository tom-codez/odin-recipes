            <h1><u>Mexican Chicken Bake</u></h1>
            <p>A high-protein, low-calorie meal that leaves you FULL. It's so flavorful. Goes great with cornbread and/or a side of refried beans. You can use whatever Mexican spices you want. We love cumin!</p>

            <h2><u>Ingredients:</u></h2>
            <ul>
                <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
                <li>4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
                <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
                <li>4 ounces shredded Mexican cheese blend</li>
                <li>1 cup salsa</li>
            </ul>

            <h2><u>Instructions:</u></h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
                <li>Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Season one side of chicken breasts with half the cumin, half the garlic powder, salt, and black pepper; arrange chicken breasts with seasoned sides down in the hot oil. Fry until chicken is lightly browned on the bottom, 4 to 5 minutes.</li>
                <li>Season the top of each chicken breast with the remaining cumin, remaining garlic powder, salt, and black pepper; flip chicken and cook until other side is lightly browned, 4 to 5 minutes. If the skillet gets dry, pour in just enough juice from the salsa to keep it from burning.</li>
                <li>Transfer chicken breasts to a 9x9-inch baking dish; sprinkle with Mexican cheese blend. Loosen all the drippings from the skillet with a little more juice from the salsa and pour on top of chicken breasts. Spoon salsa over cheese layer.</li>
                <li>Bake chicken breasts until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, 20 to 25 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
